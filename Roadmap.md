# This is a roughly prioritized list of planned improvements.

_Add suggestions [here](https://github.com/theProgramLuke/chess_opening_drills/issues)._

- automatic backups
- Repertoire health
  - warning for multiple choices from same position on my turn
  - blunder detection
- add +- etc annotation to position
- reset appearance
- persist edit position annotations (arrows etc)
- configurable max training attempts
- add training stats to training complete!
- per position training history
- upload anonymous training history
- server mode? Would be good for mobile use
- use vuetify color scheme for plots
