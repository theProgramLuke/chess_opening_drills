- comments for new storage
- append comments on import PGN overlap
- configurable max training attempts
- scrollable moves list
- per position training history
- Repertoire health
  - warning for multiple move choices from same position on my turn
  - blunder detection
- add +- etc annotation to position
- reset appearance
