# This is a roughly prioritized list of planned improvements.

_Add suggestions [here](https://github.com/theProgramLuke/chess_opening_drills/issues)._

- warning for multiple move choices from same position on my turn
- configurable max training attempts
- scrollable moves list
- per position training history report
- compressed storage? this might be slow
- blunder detection
- add +- etc annotation to position
- reset appearance
- add training stats to training complete!
- telemetry?
- server mode? Would be good for mobile use
- use vuetify color scheme for plots
