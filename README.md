A cross platform chess opening preparation tool.

**This is an unfinished tool under active development and should be considered unstable. Saved repertoires may be incompatible with future versions. Keep PGN backups of your repertoire.**

## Features

- Import and export your repertoire as PGN.
- Transpositions between variations are detected automatically.
- Train positions using a modified [SM-2](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/english/ol/sm2) spaced repetition algorithm.
- Generate reports on your repertoire and training history.
