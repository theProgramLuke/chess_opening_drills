Chess Opening Drills is a modern, cross platform tool for _practicing_ an opening repertoire. Chess Opening Drills is not a database tool to develop a repertoire, there are already many tools available for that.

## Installation

## Features

- Train moves using a modified [SM-2](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/english/ol/sm2) spaced repetition algorithm.
- Generate reports on your repertoire and training history.
- Transpositions between variations are detected automatically.
- Import and export your repertoire as PGN.
- Automatic repertoire backups.
